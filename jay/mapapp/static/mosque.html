     The mosque is dedicated to a Muslim saint, Nadayara, who is believed to have miraculous powers. The mosque is 
     a major attraction for tourists and local Muslims. 
     It also has a large orphanage and a college
     Mosques can be found all over the world and vary in size and function. 
    They can be any place where prayers (salah) are performed, including outdoor courtyards. 
    However, many mosques are large buildings with beautiful towers and domes. Inside of a mosque always includes an open 
    space for worship. 
    The first mosque was the courtyard in the home of Muhammad, Islam's founder. The first mosques were simple places of 
    prayer for Muslims, and may have been open spaces rather than buildings..</font>
